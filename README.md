Stop manually copying data—start automating it. 🤖📊
I just finished a project focused on transforming the Amazon marketplace into a structured dataset. Using Python, Selenium, and undetected-chromedriver, I built a scraper that bypasses common automation hurdles to extract:
✅ Product Names 
✅ Real-time Pricing 
✅ User Ratings
In this video, I walk through the logic of navigating multiple search result pages and how to systematically log elements for thousands of items.
Why this matters: Whether it’s for competitive pricing analysis, market research, or sentiment tracking, being able to turn an e-commerce interface into a clean CSV/Database is a superpower for any Data Analyst.
